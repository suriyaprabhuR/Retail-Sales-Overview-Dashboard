# Retail-Sales-Overview-Dashboard

📊Power BI Dashboard Project | 🚀 Retail Sales Overview


🚀 Retail Sales & Customer Analytics Project

I recently worked on a comprehensive retail dataset consisting of five interconnected tables: Customers, Orders, Order Items, Products, and Sales Targets. This project focuses on analyzing business performance, customer behavior, and sales trends to generate meaningful insights for decision-making.

The dataset captures complete sales transactions — from customer details and product information to order-level data and target performance tracking. By connecting these tables, I was able to perform in-depth analysis on revenue generation, product demand, customer purchasing patterns, and target achievement

Built an interactive Power BI Sales dashboard using Retail Sales data to analyse performance and business trends.

📌 Key insights

Total customers - 300
Total Sales - $844.67k
Total Products - 300
Total orders - 186
Total Brands - 4
